Hello!

In order to run the game just run "python test.py"

Your torch version must be 1.6 or higher, lower versions will not be able to load the model
The places in code that you are likely would like to change are indicated with comments like this one:

#############################Load example model here############################ 

We used seperate model for each player, so please remove only players from pink team. Their names are agent_p1 and agent_p2. And leave agent_b1, and agent_b2.
For model loading we use those functions: agent_b1.load_model(......), etc

The firs player is able to commit 6 action (4 linear + 2 rotation)
The second player - 4 actions (4 linear)

We devided training into 2 stages. Firstly the team was training against a team of random moving bots(for this we have train.py). Later we use the resulting model for training team by team. 

If you have any questions regarding code contact me any time.
